1.) Using JavaDoc comments to promote code reuse and readability. 
For example if you use JavaDoc style comments instead of ordinary 
//comments the JavaDoc comments will pop up when click on a method, like with the Java libraries.


2.) Estimated the probably of running through the entire program and having a collision by 
	finding the probability of going through the simulation without a collision and then subtracting
	that value from 1.  
	The probability of no collisions 			Pr[Good]=n!/(k!n^k)
	and the probability of having a collision 	Pr[Bad]=1-{n!/k!n^k}
		where n=number of places in the hash table
			  k=number of elements attempting to hash
			  
	Tried to use probability to determine the number of buckets to use in code but received errors 
	due to the numbers getting too large to compute for anything over a couple hundred entries.
