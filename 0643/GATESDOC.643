DESCRIPTION OF THE FILE GATES.DAT

     The file GATES.DAT contains all the  data  relating  to
spelling  from  the book 'A List of Spelling Difficulties in
3876 Words' by Arthur I.  Gates, published by the Bureau  of
Publications,  Teachers  College,  Columbia  University, New
York City, 1937.  The following are extracts from the book's
introduction:

     'This monograph includes  several  types  of  pertinent
data  concerning  each  of  3,876  words  commonly taught in
spelling courses in American schools.  The experimental  and
statistical  work  was  conducted  over  a  number  of years
beginning in 1928.  The steps in the work were as follows.

     'A list of "most commonly taught" words was first drawn
up  by  determining  the  frequency  with  which  the  words
appeared  in  twenty-five  different  widely  used  spelling
textbooks,  and  state  and large-city spelling lists.  From
this distribution the words appearing most  frequently  were
selected.   The limitation to 3,876 words was arbitrary.  It
should be noted that this is a list of words most frequently
chosen  by  those  who  make  up  the textbooks and spelling
lists, and it therefore doubtless includes the  3,876  words
most  frequently taught in American classrooms.  The present
author makes no claim that this is the best list of words to
teach.   It  is,  however,  a  list  which  spelling experts
believe to be best.  No claim  is  made,  furthermore,  that
3,876  words  is  the optimum number to teach.  This number,
however, is close to the average  number  contained  in  the
lists and texts studied.

     'Many words in this list were placed at different grade
levels  in  the  various texts and state or city lists.  The
mean of these grade placements was computed for  each  word,
and  is  entered  in  the  list  in  this  monograph.  [This
information is not  included  in  GATES.DAT.   -  R.M.]  The
author  makes  no claim that these mean grade placements are
ideal.  They indicate approximately the grade  placement  at
which  the  words  are  most commonly introduced in American
schools.

....

     'The most  important  part  of  the  monograph  is  the
evidence   concerning   the  characteristics  of  errors  in
spelling each of the 3,876 words.  To obtain these data  the
words  were  used  in  spelling tests in which the responses
were made in writing.  The words were pronounced, used in  a
sentence or two to define the meaning, pronounced again, and
then written by the pupils.  The subjects for the tests were
pupils  in  various public schools in the metropolitan area,
mainly from Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Each word  was  usually
given to a class one grade lower than the grade in which the



                                                      Page 2


word was formerly [I  think  he  means  'formally'  -  R.M.]
taught  in  the  curriculum of this particular school.  This
policy was adopted in order to secure  a  larger  number  of
misspellings  than  would  have  been  forthcoming after the
pupils had studied the word.   That  is  to  say,  for  most
pupils  misspellings  are  instances  of  failure to solve a
spelling problem rather than failure to recall  a  practiced
spelling.   This,  of  course, will not be universally true.
Many children  write  words,  look  them  up  in  books  and
dictionaries, and study them before encountering them in the
spelling program.

     'In the Spelling List beginning on page  11  the  first
column  consists  of the word correctly spelled, followed by
one, two, or three figures in parentheses.  It will be noted
that  certain  letters in most words are in italics and that
in some words two parts of the word are italicized, or  that
one part is italicized and another part appears in bold face
letters.  (Bold  face  is  used  when  the  two  parts  come
together,  so  that  they  may be easily distinguished.) The
part of the word italicized or in bold face is the  part  in
which  the  greatest number of errors are made.  If the word
has two parts italicized, or one part italicized and another
part  in  bold  face, it means that two parts are especially
hard.  The figure or figures  in  italics  give  the  actual
percentages.   For example, in the first word "ability", the
largest number of errors consist of failures on  the  second
"i",   which  is  italicized.   The  figure  in  parentheses
indicates that 61% of the  misspellings  of  this  word  are
failures  on the "i".  In the second word "able", 91% of the
errors are on the letters "le", which  are  italicized.   In
the  word  "abundance",  the  hard spots are the "u" and the
second "a", both of which are italicized.   In  48%  of  the
misspellings  there  is  an  error on the "u" and in 73% the
error is on the second "a".  In the word "absent",  the  two
hard  spots  are  the  "b"  and the "s", the first of which,
showing 38% errors, is italicized, and the second of  which,
showing  43%  errors, is in bold face.  The second hard spot
is given in bold face to indicate that it is to  be  thought
of  as  separate  from  the preceding letter "b" in italics,
which is also a hard spot.  In this word the "b" and the "s"
are  treated  separately, or as representing two hard spots,
for the reason that they fall into different  syllables  and
are  commonly treated as parts of two units within the word.
In the word  "acquaintance",  with  three  hard  spots,  the
percentage  of  the  total  number of errors in each case is
given.  In certain cases, the  hard  spot  is  indicated  by
letters  in  parentheses  above  or beside a word.  Thus, in
"appears", an "(e)" is placed above the  space  between  the
last  two  letters.   This  means that the hard spot is this
space - the result of inserting an  "e".   In  the  case  of
"avoid", an "(e)" follows the word and means that the ending
of the word, due to a tendency to add  an  "e",  is  a  hard
spot.

     'The second column of the Spelling List gives the  most
common misspelling of the word, and the third column the per
cent of the total errors which this  particular  misspelling
represents.  Thus, in the case of "ability", the most common
misspelling is "abilaty".  Of all the errors  made  on  this
word,  41.9%  take  exactly this form.  This word is spelled
"abbility" in 22.6% of the cases.  That is to  say,  of  all
the misspellings of this word, 64.5% are one or the other of
these two forms.  The second  word  "able"  shows  only  one
common  misspelling, namely "abel", which accounts for 35.1%
of the total misspellings.  The third word, "aboard", has no
misspelling  which  appears  clearly  more  frequently  than
others.   This  word  is  obviously  spelled  a  great  many
different  ways, although, as the first column shows, 59% of
the errors reveal difficulties in "oa".

     'The number of misspellings analyzed differs from  word
to  word,  but  in  no case is it less than 200.  The median
number of misspellings per word is slightly  over  300,  and
for about a quarter of the words the number exceeds 400.  It
is believed that the number of  misspellings,  even  at  the
minimum,  is  sufficient  to  give a fairly reliable result.
For all the words, more  than  1,200,000  misspellings  were
analyzed.

....

     'It should be noted that, although  the  data  in  this
monograph  were  obtained from a large number of cases, they
may, nevertheless, not present an entirely accurate  picture
of the facts that would be found in other localities.  It is
possible,  for  example,  that  the  spelling   errors   are
conditioned  somewhat  by  the  time and methods of teaching
words, by the frequency with which the  words  are  used  in
writing,  and  by  the  typical  pronunciation  of  a  given
locality.   Children  habitually  using  the  characteristic
speech  of Boston, or of Portland, Maine, or of New Orleans,
or of Houston, Texas, may reveal somewhat different forms of
misspelling.   In  this monograph no endeavour has been made
to determine the extent to which the misspellings differ  as
the  result  of  these  and  other  factors.   It  should be
realized, however, that the population of the schools in New
York  City  is  extremely  diversified and that all forms of
language background are represented.  It  is  believed  that
the  list  gives  a  reasonably  representative  picture  of
misspellings, although it is not denied that children living
in  quite  different  localities or speaking quite different
dialects might differ somewhat in their  spelling  from  any
representative list.'

     Each line of GATES.DAT begins with the  word  correctly
spelt  (correctly  according to American spelling, that is -
'color',  'honor'  and  the  like).   In  Gates's  book  (as
explained  in  the  above  extracts),  the  'hard spots' are
marked by italics  or  bold  letters.   In  GATES.DAT,  this
aspect  of  the  data  is represented by the words beginning
with $.  For example, in Gates's text,  the  second  'i'  of
'ability'  is italicized and the word is followed by '(61)',
meaning (in Gates's words) that '61% of the misspellings  of
this word are failures on the "i".' In GATES.DAT, the second
'i' is capitalized, so the word is shown  as  '$abilIty 61'.
Where  Gates  uses  a  small letter in parentheses above the
word or at the  end  of  the  word,  to  indicate  that  the
children  tended to insert a letter at that point, GATES.DAT
contains a '%' in the $ word.  For example, Gates's 'aid(e)'
and 'a(r)larm' are given as '$aid%' and '$a%larm'.

     The most common misspellings are given in GATES.DAT  by
the  words  beginning  with  '*'.   For  example, 'abbility'
accounted for 22.6% of all the  misspellings  of  'ability',
and  'abilaty'  for  41.9%.  This is shown as '*abbility 23'
and '*abilaty 42'.  (Note  that  Gates  does  not  give  the
proportion of children who spelled the word correctly.)

     A few words, such as  'America'  and  'Christmas',  are
correctly  spelt  with  an initial capital letter.  To avoid
confusion with the capitals that have been used in GATES.DAT
to  indicate  the  'hard spots', these words have been spelt
with  initial   lower-case   letters,   ie   'america'   and
'christmas'.

     Some of the headwords are actually two words,  eg  'all
right'  and  'santa claus'.  To indicate that they are to be
taken as a single item, they are joined in  GATES.DAT  by  a
single underline, eg 'all_right'.

     Some of the words in Gates's book  are  listed  without
any  hard  spots  and  without  any  common misspellings, eg
'all'.   They  are  included   in   GATES.DAT   merely   for
completeness.

     There is one place where the percentage was omitted  in
Gates's  book,  namely for the hard spot in "I'd";  a figure
of 00 has been inserted here.

     It would be nice to know the ages of the  children  who
were  tested  on  each  word,  but  this  information is not
provided.   Presumably  the  easier  words  were  tested  on
younger  children  and  the  harder  ones on older children.
From the figures that Gates gives for mean  grade  placement
of  each  word  in the spelling lists (these figures are not
included  in  GATES.DAT),  it  can  be  estimated  that  the
youngest children were aged about 7 and the oldest about 13.
However, since words were probably introduced  at  different
grades  in  different  schools,  the  children tested on any



                                                      Page 5


particular word will have been drawn from  different  grades
and therefore been of different ages.

     Gates does not say who administered the  tests  or  who
marked  them  and classified them.  However, I have had some
correspondence with Dr Leonard Wheat, who was one of Gates's
research  assistants  on this study in the year 1930-31.  He
tells me that the tests were administered by the  children's
schoolteachers,  after  careful  instruction by the research
staff.  The teachers made use of the test results,  but  all
tests  were  evaluated  promptly by the research assistants.
(Dr Wheat also confirmed that, though the scripts were  kept
for several years, it is unlikely that they still exist.)

     The file has one line for each of Gates's  test  words.
The  version on tape has each line padded out with spaces to
95 characters - the length of the longest line plus 1.
