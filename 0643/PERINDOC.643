A DESCRIPTION OF THE THREE PERIN FILES

     The material in the files  PERIN1.DAT,  PERIN2.DAT  and
PERIN3.DAT   was  supplied  by  Dr  Dolores  Perin,  who  is
currently (1984) working at the Center for Advanced Study in
Education,  City  University of New York, 33 West 42 Street,
New York, N.Y.  10036.

     The first two files contain material collected  in  the
course  of  the  research she carried out in the late 1970's
for her PhD at Sussex University.  PERIN1.DAT  contains  the
results  of  two  tests given to 42 subjects, these 42 being
made up of 36 fifteen-year-old boys at  a  secondary  school
and six men receiving Adult Literacy tuition.  The following
is from Dr Perin's PhD thesis:

     'The 36  boys  were  all  pupils  at  a  working  class
comprehensive  school  in  Brighton, with a mean age of 15.5
years (SD=.31).  Many had spelling  problems,  and  subjects
were  in  the  middle  and  bottom bands of the fourth form.
Testing took place during the last two months of the  school
year,  and  subjects  were  among  the  oldest pupils in the
school expecting to leave during the  following  year.   The
head  of the English department of the school chose subjects
who had both reading  and  spelling  difficulty  of  varying
degrees.   Twelve  of the poorest readers were in a remedial
class and the other subjects were in the middle  band.   All
the  subjects' IQs were in the normal range, ie 85 or above,
and  vision  and  hearing  were   normal.    Motivation   to
participate in the study was high on the part of both pupils
and teachers.'

     'The adult literacy sample consisted of six men who had
been  receiving help with their reading and spelling through
the Brighton Adult Literacy Campaign.  The organizers of the
scheme  requested  that  permission  for testing be acquired
from both the student and his tutor.  ...  One  subject  was
in his early twenties, three were in their thirties, one was
in his early  forties  and  one  was  58  years  old.   Once
subjects  overcame their initial trepidation at being placed
in a testing situation, motivation to participate was high.'

     In PERIN1.DAT, the 36 school students are  numbered  01
to  36,  and  the six adult-literacy students 37 to 42.  The
first part of each student's results gives the  misspellings
they  made  on  a  dictation  of  the  following passage (an
extract from a government booklet):

     'If you are aged 16-19 and unemployed you  should  take
advantage  of  the  special  training  schemes  run  by  the
government for unemployed young  people.   Enquire  at  your
local  Jobcentre about the different schemes available.  You
can choose to work for  an  employer  on  the  spot  to  get
experience  of a particular type of job or you can work on a

special project.  Or you may prefer  to  work  in  Community
Industry.   There  are  also  courses run to help you choose
which kind of work suits you best and courses to  train  you
for a particular job at operator or semi-skilled level.'

     Each misspelling in PERIN1.DAT is  given  a  number  to
show  which  word  it relates to.  The words are numbered as
follows:

     '1 If 2 you 3 are 4 aged 16-19 5 and 6 unemployed 7 you
8 should   9 take   10 advantage   11 of  12 the  13 special
14 training 15 schemes  16 run  17 by  18 the  19 government
20 for  21 unemployed  22 young 23 people.  24 Enquire 25 at
26 your 27 local 28 Jobcentre 29 about  30 the  31 different
32 schemes  33 available.   34 You  35 can  36 choose  37 to
38 work 39 for 40 an 41 employer 42 on 43 the 44 spot  45 to
46 get  47 experience 48 of 49 a 50 particular 51 type 52 of
53 job 54 or 55 you 56 can  57 work  58 on  59 a  60 special
61 project.   62 Or  63 you  64 may  65 prefer 66 to 67 work
68 in 69 Community  70 Industry.   71 There  72 are  73 also
74 courses  75 run  76 to  77 help 78 you 79 choose 80 which
81 kind  82 of  83 work  84 suits  85 you   86 best   87 and
88 courses  89 to  90 train 91 you 92 for 93 a 94 particular
95 job 96 at 97 operator 98 or 99 semi-skilled 100 level.'

     The  students  were  tested  individually,  the  school
students  during  time  allocated  for  English lessons, the
adult literacy students in their own homes or in Dr  Perin's
home.   First,  the student read the passage aloud, then the
student copied the passage, and then the student  wrote  the
passage  to dictation.  After the dictation, the student was
asked to read what he had  written,  checking  for  spelling
errors,  and was permitted to make alterations if he wished.
The misspellings given in PERIN1.DAT are those that remained
in   the   students'   writing   after   this  proofreading.
Continuation lines begin with a '+', and the list ends  with
a '!'.  A '#' means there were no errors.

     The second part of each  student's  results  (the  part
starting  on  a  new  line that begins with a '$') gives the
misspellings that  were  made  in  a  different  test.   The
following passage was read out by the experimenter:

     'There was a very  big  diamond,  one  of  the  biggest
diamonds in the world.  It was being shown in a museum.  The
museum was always crowded.  One day, there was a bomb scare.
Everyone  had to leave the museum, even the men guarding the
diamond.  When the guards returned, the  diamond  was  gone.
It turned out that thieves pretending to be bomb experts had
stolen it.'

     The students were then told to write the story in their
own  words,  changing  or  elaborating  it  as  much as they
wished.  They were told not to be too concerned about making
spelling  errors;   if  they  were unsure of their spelling,



                                                      Page 3


they should guess.

     The misspellings are listed  followed  by  the  correct
spelling.   Errors  of  capitalisation  or  punctuation were
generally ignored.  If the spelling contained a  space,  the
space   is  underlined  (eg  'evry_body'  for  'everybody').
Continuation lines begin with a '+'.  The list ends  with  a
'!'.  A '#' means there were no errors.

     The second file - PERIN2.DAT  -  contains  misspellings
taken  from the free writing of six adult-literacy students,
as listed in  Appendix  XVII  of  Dr  Perin's  thesis.   She
describes this material as follows:

     'The writing from which these errors are taken was done
in  a  number of creative writing sessions in adult literacy
classes.  Students were greatly encouraged by their teachers
to  write  freely without being slowed down by concentrating
on  correct  spelling.   ...   In  the  course  of  writing,
subjects  would  guess  at  unfamiliar  spellings  and would
occasionally  ask  the  teacher  for  assistance.   ..   Six
students  -  three  good  readers (three men) and three poor
readers (two men and one woman) - agreed to contribute a few
of  their original pieces of writing for this analysis.  ...
The students were approached after their pieces had all been
written  and  therefore  their  work  was  not influenced by
knowing that it would be analyzed.'

     'When it was not completely self-evident from the error
what  the subject had intended to write, he or she was asked
to verify what the intention had been.  This was  done  soon
after   the   pieces   had  been  written.   Repetitions  of
misspellings were not included in the  analysis.   If  there
was   more  than  one  misspelling  for  a  word,  both  are
indicated.  The errors were produced on  between  three  and
five pieces of writing of various lengths.'

     In PERIN2.DAT, '$1' indicates the start  of  the  first
student's  errors,  and  so  on.   They  are listed as in Dr
Perin's appendix, namely the correct  spelling  followed  by
the   misspelling   (this   is  the  other  way  round  from
PERIN1.DAT).  Each student's list ends with a '!'.

     The third file - PERIN3.DAT - contains the misspellings
made  by  a  sample  of  14-  and 15-year-olds in five inner
London comprehensive schools in response to a spelling test.
The   tests   were  administered  as  part  of  a  screening
procedure, to identify subjects for subsequent experiments -
see  Dolores  Perin,  'Phonemic  segmentation and spelling',
British Journal of Psychology, 1983, Vol 74, pages 129-144.

     The children were tested  in  class  by  their  English
teachers.   Each  test  word  was  read out, then given in a
sentence, then read out again.  The words were as follows:

     PERIN3.DAT contains a one-in-four sample of the scripts
collected   in   this  study.   Each  child  begins  with  a
three-digit serial number.  Then  follows  a  code  for  the
school  (A  to  E)  and  the  child's sex (M, F or ?  if not
known).   Then  the   list   of   misspellings   is   given;
continuation lines begin with a '+' and the list ends with a
'!'.  A '#' means that the child made no errors.  A '..' for
a  spelling  means  that  the  child made no attempt at this
word.
