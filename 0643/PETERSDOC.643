A DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES PETERS1.DAT AND PETERS2.DAT

     The material for these two files  was  provided  by  Dr
Margaret Peters, who was, until 1984, Tutor at the Cambridge
Institute of Education.  It was collected in the course of a
piece  of  research conducted in Cambridge in the 1960's and
described  by  Margaret  Peters  in  her  book  'Success  in
Spelling',  published  in 1970 by the Cambridge Institute of
Education,    Shaftesbury    Road,    Cambridge     CB2 2BX,
(ISBN 9500202 3 0).

     In brief, Dr Peters administered  a  test  to  all  the
children  (over  900  of  them)  in  the  second-year junior
classes (ie children born between 1 Sept 54 and 31  Aug  55)
of the Cambridge Local Education Authority, in July 1964 (so
most of the children were aged  nine  when  they  took  this
first  test).   In  July  1965, she visited the same schools
again and administered another test to the same children (by
this time mostly aged ten), and in July 1966, she tested the
same children yet again.  These three tests are described in
her  book,  and  it  is  the  results  of  these  tests that
constitute most of the material in PETERS1.DAT.

     In July 1970, Dr Peters visited the Cambridge secondary
schools  and  gave a further test to those same children (by
now  aged  15  and  in  their  final  year   of   compulsory
education).   It  is  this  material that forms the basis of
PETERS2.DAT.  (Pressure of work  prevented  Dr  Peters  from
analysing it herself.)

     The material for PETERS1.DAT  was  collected  by  first
drawing  a  systematic  random  sample  of one-in-six of the
scripts from the first test.  This gave  156  scripts.   The
scripts  of  these  156  children  on  the second, third and
fourth (ie  secondary  school)  tests  were  then  obtained.
(Some  of  them were missing, of course, since some children
moved out of the area;  this  applies  particularly  to  the
secondary school scripts.) Some details about each child and
a list of the errors they made on all the  tests  were  then
written  out,  and  this  information  was  keyed  into  the
computer.

     Each case begins with a '$' followed by  a  three-digit
serial  number.   Then  comes  the school code (A to S - see
below for the list), the sex (M or F) and an  assessment  of
the  handwriting  on  the  first script (1 for good to 5 for
bad);   this  assessment  was  made  by   the   people   who
transferred  the errors from the scripts to clean sheets for
subsequent keying-in.  Then comes an L (child was  noted  as
being  left-handed)  or a '-' (no note of this), a V (visual
defect noted) or a '-', and an A (auditory defect noted)  or
a '-';  for example, 'L--' means the child was noted (on the
script) as being left-handed but there was no note of visual
or auditory defect.



                                                      Page 2


     Next comes number of brothers, number  of  sisters  and
order in family;  missing information is recorded as -.  For
the order in the family, 0 (nought) means the child  was  an
only child, 1 means he/she was the eldest, and so on.  These
three fields are separated by commas, eg 0,1,2 (no brothers,
one sister, I'm the younger).

     Then comes a code for the secondary school (A  to  Y  -
see  below),  then  the  child's  own  assessment  of  their
spelling in answer to a question about this in the secondary
school  test  (1  = Yes it's good, 2 = Middling, 3 = No it's
not good) and then an assessment of the handwriting  on  the
fourth  (ie the secondary school) script - again made by the
people who transferred the errors prior to keying-in.  A '-'
for   these  fields  indicates  that  this  information  was
missing, usually  because  there  was  no  secondary  school
script for the child.

     The final two codes on the  first  line  of  each  case
indicate  the  socio-economic class of the child's family (A
to E), as assessed by the child's primary-school teacher  in
their  final year, and an assessment of the child's creative
writing, again by their primary-school teacher,  the  grades
meaning:

A Very vivid and lively writing
B Interesting writing
C Writes adequately
D Writing dull and uninteresting
E Does not achieve written expression beyond very
  factual and simple level

As usual, a '-' indicates that the information was missing.

     Each child's spelling errors are then given.  They  are
grouped into eight sections - %1T (the spelling test part of
the first test), %1D (the dictation part of the first test),
similarly %2T, %2D, %3T and %3D, then %4T (the spelling test
part of the secondary school test) and %4W (the free-writing
part of the secondary school test).

     The spelling test parts of all four tests consisted  of
some  section of the following.  The word was read out, then
a sentence of context, then the word again;  the  child  had
to write down just the test word:

 1 ON  Will you put the kettle on?
 2 HOT  The water is hot.
 3 CUP  Will you have another cup?
 4 VAN  The furniture came in a van.
 5 JAM  Do you like sandwiches made of jam?
 6 LOST  The dog was lost.
 7 SIT  Where will you sit?
 8 PLAN  I have a good plan.
 9 MUD  Their shoes were covered with mud.

     The following words were also sometimes used.  There is

82 mechanical      92 exceptionally      102 affectionately
83 anxious         93 successful         103 attorney

89 financial       99 referring          109 irresistible
90 capacity       100 courteous          110 hydraulic

     The spelling test part of the first test used  words  1
to  40.   The spelling test part of the second test began at
word 11;  for the third test it began at word 21 ,  and  for
the  fourth  (secondary  school)  test, it began at word 31.
Sometimes, if Dr Peters felt that  the  class  could  easily
cope  with  the earlier words, she skipped the first part of
the test.  This is marked in PETERS1.DAT as,  for  instance,
>30, meaning that words up to and including 30 were omitted.
How many of the  more  difficult  words  were  given  varied
somewhat from one class to another.

     A '-' for  a  particular  word  in  a  child's  results
indicates  that  this word was given as part of the test but
this child made no attempt to  write  it.   The  errors  are
written  entirely in lower-case letters, though the children
often wrote in a mixture  of  upper-  and  lower-case.   The
children's  handwriting was sometimes illegible;  the people
copying out the errors simply made the best guess they could
of  what the children had written.  A '-' for the whole test
means that this script is missing for this child.  A '#' for
the  test  means  that the child made no errors.  The end of
the list of errors is marked by a '!'.

     After the spelling test,  the  children  were  given  a
dictation.   The dictation in the first test was as follows.
(Each word is  numbered  so  that  one  can  tell,  given  a
misspelling  in PETERS1.DAT, which word the child was trying
to write.)

     '1 One 2 day, 3 as 4 I 5 was 6 walking 7 down  8 Bridge
9 Street,  10 I  11 heard 12 the 13 sound 14 of 15 trotting.
16 I  17 turned  18 and  19 saw   20 behind   21 me   22 the
23 shaggy 24 dark 25 hair 26 of 27 a 28 frightened 29 little
30 horse.  31 I 32 searched 33 in  34 my  35 pockets  36 for
37 an 38 apple 39 from 40 my 41 dinner 42 to 43 give 44 him.
'45 I  46 know  47 where  48 you  49 should   50 be,'   51 I
52 said.   53 So  54 I 55 removed 56 the 57 belt 58 of 59 my
60 raincoat 61 and 62 tied 63 it  64 around  65 his  66 neck
67 and   68 led   69 him  70 back.   71 I  72 opened  73 the
74 gate, 75 and 76 with  77 satisfaction  78 he  79 galloped
80 into  81 his  82 own  83 field.  84 I 85 was 86 certainly
87 very  88 happy  89 that  90 now  91 he  92 was   93 safe,
94 away   95 from   96 the   97 noisy   98 and  99 dangerous
100 traffic.'

     After this dictation, Dr  Peters  said  'I  expect  you
would  like to know the little horse's name.  Well, first of
all I will tell you his mother's name.  I am going  to  show
it to you for a very short time and then hide it and ask you
to write it from memory.' She then showed them  a  card  for
four  seconds  with the word FLAGRANCY on it.  (This appears
in this section  of  PETERS1.DAT  as  word  101.)  Then  she
continued  'Very  few people know the pony's name, but I do.
I will let you into the  secret,  but  you  must  not  start
writing  till  I  say GO and hold up your pencils when I say
STOP.' She then showed a card for  three  seconds  with  the
word  VAGABOND on it, and gave them ten seconds to write it.
(This is word 102.)

     The dictation in the second test was as follows:

     '1 Late  2 one  3 night  4 my  5 friend   6 woke   7 me
8 saying  '9 Would  10 you  11 enjoy 12 a 13 trial-run 14 in
15 my  16 new  17 helicopter?'   18 I   19 had   20 scarcely
21 scrambled  22 into  23 my  24 tracksuit  25 before  26 we
27 were 28 away.   29 The  30 lights  31 of  32 the  33 city
34 glowed   35 beneath:   36 the  37 stars  38 above.   39 I
40 was  41 beginning   42 to   43 wonder   44 about   45 our
46 destination  47 when 48 I 49 caught 50 sight 51 of 52 the
53 spinning 54 knife 55 edge 56 and 57 the 58 surface  59 of
60 what 61 must 62 have 63 been 64 a 65 type 66 of 67 flying
68 saucer  69 whistling  70 round  71 us.   72 We  73 dodged
74 skilfully 75 to 76 avoid 77 an 78 accident.  79 To 80 our
81 relief, 82 the 83 spacecraft 84 regained 85 height 86 and
87 we   88 sank   89 down   90 to   91 earth  92 and  93 the
94 comfortable  95 bed  96 I  97 had  98 never   99 actually
100 left.'



                                                      Page 6


     After the dictation, Dr Peters held up cards for  three
seconds  each  with these words on:  FRUIT (word 101), FIELD
(word 102), LODGE (word 103).  She then  spoke  these  three
words:   SUITABLE  (word  104),  BELIEF (word 105) and HEDGE
(word 106).

     The dictation in the third test was as follows:

     '1 A  2 peculiar  3 shape  4 was  5 approaching  6 from
7 the    8 southern    9 valley.     10 Gradually    11 they
12 distinguished 13 a 14 recently  15 designed  16 aeroplane
17 circling  18 above.  19 The 20 machine 21 touched 22 down
23 with 24 precision 25 in  26 the  27 rough  28 mountainous
29 region  30 without 31 even 32 scraping 33 its 34 surface.
35 The  36 children  37 surrounded  38 the  39 pilot  40 who
41 explained     42 that    43 his    44 altimeter    45 and
46 temperature  47 gauge  48 were  49 damaged  50 and  51 he
52 was  53 anxious  54 about 55 increasing 56 altitude 57 in
58 these   59 freezing   60 conditions.    61 From    62 the
63 alpine   64 school  65 he  66 telephoned  67 his  68 base
69 requesting   70 spare    71 instruments    72 to    73 be
74 delivered   75 and   76 fitted   77 immediately.   78 The
79 children    80 viewed    81 the    82 repairs     83 with
84 enthusiasm,   85 especially   86 when   87 they   88 were
89 taken  90 in  91 groups  92 for  93 an   94 unforgettable
95 flight     96 before     97 the    98 pilot's    99 final
100 departure.'

     In transferring the errors from the dictations,  errors
of  punctuation  were  generally  ignored, as were errors of
word-division in 'raincoat', 'trial-run',  'spacecraft'  and
'tracksuit'.   Uncrossed t's were not counted as errors, and
inserted words were ignored,  such  as  'type  of  a  flying
saucer'  for  'type  of  flying saucer'.  If the misspelling
contained a space,  this  is  marked  by  an  underline,  eg
'a_prochin' for 'approaching'.

     Some of the children's efforts were largely  illegible,
often  with  phrases  missed  out, so that it was not always
possible to say which words the child was trying  to  write.
The  people transferring the errors simply did the best they
could.  No effort  was  made  to  record  which  words  were
omitted,  and  errors were not recorded if it was impossible
to see which words in the dictation they corresponded to.

     There was no dictation in the fourth (secondary school)
test.   Instead,  the  children were asked to write, for ten
minutes, on 'Memories of my  primary  school'.   The  errors
from  these  compositions  are  given  in PETERS1.DAT in the
section beginning %4W.  They  are  given  in  the  following
form:

misspelling   correct_spelling   some context

eg rember   remember   Also I * the boys there



                                                      Page 7


The '*' in the context indicates where the misspelling came.
As  in  the  dictations, an underline in the misspelling (or
the correct spelling) indicates a space, eg

any_way   anyway   we got caned *
infront   in_front   show people up * of others

Where it was not clear what word was intended,  the  correct
spelling may be preceded by a '?'.  For example:

ctans   ?curtains   there were these *

Proper names were ignored except where the context  made  it
fairly  clear what the spelling should be;  for instance, 'a
boy called Lenard' should  probably  be  'Leonard'  but  one
cannot  be sure, whereas 'a day trip to Lester' seems almost
certain to be 'Leicester'.

     If the context contained a  misspelling,  the  misspelt
form has been recorded in the context.  For example:

assemberly   assembly   we had * ever morning
ever   every   we had assemberly * morning

     Errors of punctuation were generally ignored, including
errors  of  capitalisation such as 'mr smith' for 'Mr Smith'
and misplaced possessive apostrophes as in "teachers'  name"
for  "teacher's  name".   Misspellings including apostrophes
were included, however, if the child had produced quite  the
wrong form of the word, as in "memory's of primary school".

     A '-' indicates that this section was  missing,  and  a
'#'  indicates  that  there  were  no  misspellings.   A '!'
indicates the end of the list.

     The  file  PETERS2.DAT  is  taken  entirely  from   the
secondary  school  material.   It contains misspellings from
all the secondary school scripts that were  left  after  the
ones for PETERS1.DAT had been removed.

     Each case begins  with  a  three-digit  serial  number,
followed  by  the  child's  sex (M, F or '?' for those cases
where it was not clear from the name).  Then  comes  a  code
for  the  school  (A  to  Y  -  see  below), the child's own
assessment of his/her spelling (1 =  Yes  it's  good;   2  =
Middling;   3  = No it's not good), and an assessment of the
child's handwriting made by the people who  transferred  the
errors (from 1 for good to 5 for bad).

     Following this, and on the same line, are  misspellings
that  the  child  made  on words 31 to 40 (see above) of the
spelling test.  (The words are numbered 1 to 10, ie 'eye' is
word  1  to  'beautiful'  word 10.) In the few cases where a
second line is needed for  these  misspellings,  the  second
line  begins  with  a '+'.  A '#' means the child got all 10



                                                      Page 8


words right.  A '..' for a particular word  means  that  the
child made no attempt at it.

     Then follow the misspellings  from  the  free  writing,
transferred  in  the  manner described above.  Each of these
lines begins with a  space.   A  '#'  means  there  were  no
misspellings in the free writing.

     The schools are identified by letters as follows:

1) Primary
