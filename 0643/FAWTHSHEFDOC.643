A DESCRIPTION OF THE FAWTHROP AND SHEFFIELD FILES

     The FAWTHROP files were put onto the computer by  David
Fawthrop   as   part  of  his  PhD  research  into  spelling
correction at Bradford University.  They  are  described  in
the   paper   'The   rules   of  spelling  errors'  by  E.J.
Yannakoudakis and D.  Fawthrop, Information  Processing  and
Management, Vol 19 No 2, 1983, pages 87-99.

     FAWTHROP1.DAT  is  the  one  that  Fawthrop  calls  the
'typical' file.  It is a list of 809 misspellings taken from
four American sources:

Lasky J.  Proof-reading and Copy Preparation, Mentor  Press,
New York, 1941, pages 84-131

Damerau F.J.   'A  technique  for  computer  detection   and
correction  of spelling errors', CACM 1964 Vol 7 No 3, pages
171-176, Table 1

Kucera H. and W.N. Francis   Computational    Analysis    of
Present-day   American   English,  Brown  University  Press,
Providence Rhode Island, 1967

Masters H.V.  'A  study  of  spelling  errors'  PhD  thesis,
University of Iowa, 1927

     Each line consists of the correct spelling in the first
twenty  columns  followed  by  the  misspelling  in the next
twenty, all in upper-case.  The 'correct' spelling was  that
which  the  original source considered to be correct, or the
one in Webster's Third New International  Dictionary,  1961.
In either case, it was correct American spelling rather than
British.

     FAWTHROP2.DAT is the one Fawthrop calls the 'bad' file.
It contains 560 misspellings taken from some 60,000 words of
continuous text written by three adults at the University of
Bradford,  each of them with a Northern English dialect, who
all believed themselves to be very bad spellers.   The  task
of   finding   the   misspellings  was  carried  out  by  an
ex-schoolteacher.  The 'correct' spelling here means the one
given in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary with addenda,
1959.  The format of the file is like that of  FAWTHROP1.DAT
except  that  the misspelling occupies columns 21 to 38, and
columns 39 and 40 contain the  number  of  times  that  each
misspelling occurred in the 60,000 words of text.

     Dr Fawthrop's research resulted in a spelling corrector
which  is now marketed, under the name of Expert Speller, by
Artificially  Intelligent  Devices  and  Techniques  (ADAT),
Bradford  University  Science  Park, 1 Campus Road, Bradford
BD7 1HR, Tel 0274 733317.

     SHEFFIELD.DAT contains 384 misspellings, mostly  typing
errors,  derived  from  either typewritten or terminal input
and collected from the staff and students of the  Department
of  Information  Studies  at  the University of Sheffield as
part of a piece of research into spelling  correction.   The
work  is described in 'Automatic spelling correction using a
trigram similarity measure' by Richard C.  Angell, George E.
Freund   and   Peter  Willett,  Information  Processing  and
Management, Vol 19 No 4, 1983, pages 255-261.  The format of
the file is the same as that of FAWTHROP1.DAT.
