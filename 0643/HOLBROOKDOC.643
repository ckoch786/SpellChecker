     The passages in HOLBROOK.DAT are taken  from  the  book
'English  for  the  Rejected'  by  David Holbrook, Cambridge
University Press, 1964.  They are extracts from the writings
of children in class 3C of a secondary school;  the children
were aged 13 or 14, in their next-to-last year of schooling.
In  a  couple  of  the  passages,  the children were copying
literary material supplied to them,  but  all  the  rest  is
their  own  writing.   The  passages  appear  in the section
'Sparks from a Different Element', pages 44-187.   They  are
linked, in the book, by description, explanation and comment
by Holbrook, and some of them make little sense without that
context.

     Holbrook  introduces  this  section  of  the  book   as
follows:

     'In this section  I  discuss  the  development  towards
literacy  of  nineteen children in one 'C' stream class in a
secondary modern school, child by child.   This  section  is
intended  to  convince  readers  of  four  main contentions.
First, that so-called 'backward' children are  not  inferior
beings,  but  are in fact sensitive, perceptive, and full of
deep  feelings,  ambitions   and   capacities   for   making
contributions  to  human life and culture.  Second, that the
best way to make them literate, in the fullest sense, is  by
imaginative  work;   that this is well within the capacities
of  any  teacher.   Third,  that  half  the   trouble   with
'backward'  children is that they feel rejected and despised
by teachers, the school and society - and that the fact  is,
unhappily,  that  they  are  so  despised.  Finally, that an
important part of our work with  them  must  be  devoted  to
curing them of the effects of feelings of failure.'

     Holbrook,  who  was  the  children's  English  teacher,
preserved  the  original  spelling  and  punctuation when he
typed the passages for publication.   The  passages  contain
occasional   words  in  square  brackets  giving  Holbrook's
interpretation of what the child meant.   The  children  are
given  fictitious  names in the book, and these are retained
in HOLBROOK.DAT, together with page  references,  to  enable
people using this material to relate it to the book.

     The text was put into computer-readable form, with  the
permission of David Holbrook and of the Cambridge University
Press, via the Kurzweil Data Entry  Machine  (KDEM)  of  the
Oxford   University   Computing   Services.   The  file  was
proofread and corrected by Philip Baker and myself.
